READ: This Project is completed. Here are the flaws:
- No Merchandise (I couldn't find any)
- Media Query for 376-600px is Unfinished (I had no way of viewing it at this size)
- Technical Debt (High use of !important and potentially overriding styles)
- Limited Javascript Interactivity (wasn't neccessary)

This is my first project on my Self Made Portfolio. My AI portfolio can be viewed here: https://codepen.io/collection/eYOZrV
